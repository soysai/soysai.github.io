                   <strong> What are languages? Rather, what counts as a language?
                    Do the squeaks and squawks animals use to communicate count as a language? 
                   </strong><br><br>
                   Honestly, the dictionary defines language as the “principal method of human communication”, but I think otherwise. 
                   Personally, I believe that any mode of 
                   <em>standardized</em> communication can be considered as a language, regardless of the kind of creature that uses it. 
                   <br> <br>
                   I have read that animals use very particular scents, pitches of sounds, actions etc. 
                   that mean very specific things in order to communicate. When one being is able to comprehend the other and uses the same to communicate to another,
                    I think that could count as a language too (just one that we do not understand).

                    I am just a language enthusiast that has, over time, and due to lack of practice, started to lose memory of languages they were once fluent in. 
                    <br>
                    <strong>A kind of language Alzheimers you could say.</strong>
                    <br>
                    And this is my silly attempt at not losing that practice. 
                    Especially in a new city and environment. 
                    <div class="typewriter">
                   <br> <strong>Welcome to my silly little weekly logs ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶ </strong>

                </span>
                </a>

                    <p>
                       Hope you enjoyed that little pop-up right there. <br>
                       Eitherway, I think that that is how I like to communicate. It is the language that I use. i.e, little gifs and stickers and memes. <br>
                       I do have to say, I think it does the job a lot of the time. 
                       And learning how to do that, using code, itself feels like trying to understand a whole new language.<br><br>
                       <em>It feels like a new world, a new entry, a new page.</em><br><br>
                       And it is taking over a major part of my week now. <br>
                       A fine way to get back into practicing languages<br>

                      Understanding code like understanding a language, personally, makes an easy correlation. <br><br>
                       <strong>Here is what I have learnt so far:</strong> <br><br>
                       → The vocab here are all your little features and tools. For example, @keyframe is a word, so is a marquee, so is your background, font etc.<br><br>
                       → The lists, spans, and -color, -size functions are your verbs. They make the noun <em>do</em> something. <br><br>
                       → Your classes and divs are the folders, or books where all this information is stored, and html! is your overarching library. <br><br>
                    </p> 
                </div>
                <div class="wrap">
                 <div class="image">
                    <img src="https://img.universitystudent.org/1/1/2/i-understand-nothing-memes.jpg"style="float: left; 
                    margin: 10px;">
                </div>

                    Despite knowing this, I still take 8 hours to code the simplest page.<br>
                    It is indeed frustrating.<br>
                    I still struggle with my code being <em>extremely,</em><strong><em>extremely</em></strong> unorganized.<br>
                    I can't for the life of God, make it clean. <br><br>
                    Another thing I am struggling with is switching between html and css.<br>
                    I very confidently put in the "/*.....*/" to comment in html and stand there bewildered when I see all those unwanted lines being printed.<br><br>
                    
                    It reminds me of when I switch between Korean and Japanese, two languages that share a relationship similar to that of the two coding languages in question.<br>
                    They have similar words, similar functions. "学生" (Gakusei) has a similar pronounciation to "학생"(Haksaeng), 
                    "満足" (manzoku) and "만족" (manjog),"約束" (Yakusoku) and "약속"(Yaksok),"汽車"(kisha)and "기차"(kicha)and I could go on and on and on.<br><br></p>

                    <p>This <em>confused</em> me at first, but now, knowing these differences has made it <em>easier</em> to pay attention to.
                    Noticing is key to understanding, I guess I need to keep noticing to get used to it.<br> <br></p>
